# fptcloud_instance_group_policy (Data Source)

Retrieves information about the instance group policy that fpt cloud supports, with the ability to filter the results.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "fptcloud_instance_group_policy" "data" {
  vpc_id = "your_vpc_id"
  filter {
    key = "id"
    values = ["your_id"]
  }
  filter {
    key = "name"
    values = ["Soft Affinity", "Soft Anti Affinity"]
  }
}

output "show_value" {
  value = data.fptcloud_instance_group_policy.data
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `vpc_id` (String) The vpc id of the instance group policy

### Optional

- `filter` (Block Set) One or more key/value pairs on which to filter results (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `sort` (Block List) One or more key/direction pairs on which to sort results (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--sort))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `instance_group_policies` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--instance_group_policies))

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `key` (String) Filter instance_group_policies by this key. This may be one of `id`, `name`.
- `values` (List of String) Only retrieves `instance_group_policies` which keys has value that matches one of the values provided here

Optional:

- `all` (Boolean) Set to `true` to require that a field match all of the `values` instead of just one or more of them. This is useful when matching against multi-valued fields such as lists or sets where you want to ensure that all of the `values` are present in the list or set.
- `match_by` (String) One of `exact` (default), `re`, or `substring`. For string-typed fields, specify `re` to match by using the `values` as regular expressions, or specify `substring` to match by treating the `values` as substrings to find within the string field.


<a id="nestedblock--sort"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sort`

Required:

- `key` (String) Sort instance_group_policies by this key. This may be one of `id`, `name`.

Optional:

- `direction` (String) The sort direction. This may be either `asc` or `desc`.


<a id="nestedatt--instance_group_policies"></a>
### Nested Schema for `instance_group_policies`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)
- `name` (String)
