# fptcloud_floating_ip_rule_instance (Data Source)

Get information on a floating ip rule instance for use in other resources. This data source provides all of the floating ip rule instance properties as configured on your account.

An error will be raised if the provided floating ip rule instance does not exist in your account.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "fptcloud_floating_ip_rule_instance" "example" {
  vpc_id = "your_vpc_id"
  filter {
    key = "id"
    values = ["your_instance_id"]
  }
  filter {
    key = "ip_address"
    values = ["your_ip_address"]
  }
  filter {
    key = "name"
    values = ["your_instance_name"]
  }
}

output "show_value" {
  value = data.fptcloud_floating_ip_rule_instance.example
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `vpc_id` (String) The vpc id of the floating ip rule instance

### Optional

- `filter` (Block Set) One or more key/value pairs on which to filter results (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `sort` (Block List) One or more key/direction pairs on which to sort results (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--sort))

### Read-Only

- `floating_ip_rule_instance_att` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--floating_ip_rule_instance_att))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `key` (String) Filter floating_ip_rule_instance_att by this key. This may be one of `id`, `ip_address`, `name`, `type`, `vpc_id`.
- `values` (List of String) Only retrieves `floating_ip_rule_instance_att` which keys has value that matches one of the values provided here

Optional:

- `all` (Boolean) Set to `true` to require that a field match all of the `values` instead of just one or more of them. This is useful when matching against multi-valued fields such as lists or sets where you want to ensure that all of the `values` are present in the list or set.
- `match_by` (String) One of `exact` (default), `re`, or `substring`. For string-typed fields, specify `re` to match by using the `values` as regular expressions, or specify `substring` to match by treating the `values` as substrings to find within the string field.


<a id="nestedblock--sort"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sort`

Required:

- `key` (String) Sort floating_ip_rule_instance_att by this key. This may be one of `id`, `ip_address`, `name`, `type`, `vpc_id`.

Optional:

- `direction` (String) The sort direction. This may be either `asc` or `desc`.


<a id="nestedatt--floating_ip_rule_instance_att"></a>
### Nested Schema for `floating_ip_rule_instance_att`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)
- `ip_address` (String)
- `name` (String)
- `type` (String)
- `vpc_id` (String)
