# fptcloud_security_group_rule (Resource)

Provides a security group rule resource to manager rule in security group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fptcloud_security_group" "security_group_example" {
  vpc_id    = "your_vpc_id"
  name      = "your_security_group_name"
  subnet_id = "your_subnet_id"
  type      = "ACL"
}

resource "fptcloud_security_group_rule" "example_ssh_rule_for_all_traffic" {
  vpc_id            = "your_vpc_id"
  security_group_id = fptcloud_security_group.security_group_example.id
  direction         = "INGRESS"
  action            = "ALLOW"
  protocol          = "TCP"
  port_range        = "22"
  sources = ["ALL"]
  description = "inbound ssh rule for all traffic"
  # This is required to ensure the security group is created before the rule
  depends_on = [fptcloud_security_group.security_group_example]
}

resource "fptcloud_security_group_rule" "example_all_traffic_rule" {
  vpc_id            = "your_vpc_id"
  security_group_id = fptcloud_security_group.security_group_example.id
  direction         = "INGRESS"
  action            = "ALLOW"
  protocol          = "ALL"
  port_range        = "ALL"
  sources = ["ALL"]
  description       = "inbound all traffic rule"
  depends_on = [fptcloud_security_group.security_group_example]
}

resource "fptcloud_security_group_rule" "example_all_traffic_rule_for_tcp" {
  vpc_id            = "your_vpc_id"

## Schema

### Required

- `action` (String) The action of the rule can be allow or deny. When we set the `action = 'ALLOW'`, this is going to add a rule to allow traffic. Similarly, setting `action = 'DROP'` will deny the traffic.
- `direction` (String) The direction of the rule can be `INGRESS` or `EGRESS`.
- `port_range` (String) The port or port range to open, if the protocol is `ALL` this field is required `ALL`
- `protocol` (String) The protocol of the security group rule include value `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP` or `ALL`
- `security_group_id` (String) The security group id of the security group rule
- `sources` (List of String) The sources of the rule, can be a CIDR notation or a IP address, pass `ALL` if you want to open for all IP
- `vpc_id` (String) The vpc id of the security group rule

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the security group rule

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the security group rule
- `ip_type` (String) The ip type of the security group rule
