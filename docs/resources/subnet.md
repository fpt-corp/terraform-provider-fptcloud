# fptcloud_subnet (Resource)

Provides a FPT cloud instance group which can be attached to an instance in order to provide expanded subnet.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fptcloud_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id           = "your_vpc_id"
  name             = "subnet_name"
  type             = "ISOLATED | NAT_ROUTED"
  cidr             = "your_cidr"
  gateway_ip       = "your_gateway_ip"
  static_ip_pool   = "static_ip_pool_of_instance"
  primary_dns_ip   = "8.8.8.8"
  secondary_dns_ip = "8.8.4.4"
}
