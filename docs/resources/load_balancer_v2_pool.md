- `load_balancer_id` (String) The ID of the load balancer which owns the pool
- `persistence_cookie_name` (String) Required if session persistence type is APP_COOKIE
- `tls_enabled` (Boolean) Whether TLS is enabled for the pool

### Optional

- `alpn_protocols` (List of String) The ALPN protocols of the pool
- `description` (String) The description of the pool
