# fptcloud_tagging (Resource)


Provides a tagging resource to manage tags for supported FPT Cloud resources. This allows you to create, update, and delete tags, and associate them with resources such as instances, security groups, object storage buckets, and more.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fptcloud_tagging" "example" {
  key          = "env"
  value        = "production"
  color        = ""
  scope_type   = "VPC"
  resource_ids = ["resource-vpc-id-1", "resource-vpc-id-2"]
}

resource "fptcloud_tagging" "example_org" {
  key          = "env_org"
  value        = "production"
  color        = "#e7a600"
  scope_type   = "ORG"
  resource_ids = []
}
```
